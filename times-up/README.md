# Time's Up

## Description:

> Time waits for no one. Can you solve this before time runs out?

## Solution:

Using strace, an alarm signal was found out to be sent after 5000 uS. We need to evaluate the expression generated by the program within this time frame.

I used python subprocess to take in the output of the program as input, evaluate the expression, and send the result back to the program.
